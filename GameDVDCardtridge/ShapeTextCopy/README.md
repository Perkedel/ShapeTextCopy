# ShapeTextCopy
 The most famous programming assignment print shape, now a GUI parametered apps ft. Pascal memories as much I've remembered (not all though coz my 1st time harddisk burned irrecoverable)

# What is this?
Print `stars` like `*` or any single text type character you'd like with size & shape adjustable. Just like cliche programming assignment, now in GUI parametering system.

# How to use?
Just adjust each parameter however you like. Each does change the result for different aspects like Character used to form, size in width height, & shape within the size.

You can also view source codes that runs this program by opening `Source Codes` tab & choose which files you'd like to learn how the code looks like!

# Why this program?
I lost all my FreePascal program I had when I was 9th grader because I was so stupid clean installing sparsdated Windows 8 without backing up them from the Program File folder. Now the hard disk on that 1st ever laptop completely crashed irrecoverable, so all of the `pas` including all of my `png` `jpg` paint & terrible *downvotable* rage comic file are gone to dust, ***reduced to atom***. Trolino, FunnyMama, & Pulsk down, I can only recover not all. There's nothing nor donation you can do to relieve my severe depression due to this incident. I only remember `Hello World`, `Story response`, `Yandere story response`, `print stars`, and that's it.
